# lghub-settings-backup
Backs up your Logitech G HUB settings.json because G HUB loves deleting them spontaneously. It'll create a folder with a timestamp in the directory you run it on, which contains ``settings.json`` and ``settings.backup`` from ``$USER\Appdata\Local\LGHUB.`` Based on redditor jotafett's post at https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/k3da7g/just_a_reminder_remember_to_backup_your/.

## Usage
Easy, just download the code and run ``lghub-settings-backup.bat``. No admin privileges needed this time. Or you can batch it with a simple Task Scheduler task.

No warranties, as always.
